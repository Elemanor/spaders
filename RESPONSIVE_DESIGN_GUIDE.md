- Progressive enhancement for larger screens
- Custom breakpoints: xs (475px), sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px), 2xl (1536px)

### 3. Responsive Typography
- Font sizes scale appropriately across devices
- Line heights optimized for readability
- Touch-friendly minimum sizes (44px targets)

### 4. Component-Level Responsiveness

## Viewport Sizes to Test
- 320px (Small phone)
- 375px (iPhone)

### Issue: Buttons Too Small to Tap
**Solution**: Minimum 44x44px touch targets

**Solution**: max-width: 100%, height: auto

## Accessibility Considerations
- Proper heading hierarchy
- ARIA labels where needed
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast ratios (WCAG AA)
- Focus indicators visible
- Screen reader compatibility

## Performance Metrics
Target metrics:

- Largest Contentful Paint: < 2.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift: < 0.1
- First Input Delay: < 100ms

## Future Enhancements
- Progressive Web App capabilities
- Offline support
- Advanced animations (with reduced motion support)
- Dynamic viewport units (dvh, svh, lvh)
- Container queries for component-level responsiveness
